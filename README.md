# Programming Tasks

This repository contains C/C++ code implementations for various programming tasks. Each task is categorized into different levels of difficulty. Below is a brief description of each task:

## Level 1: Sorting Algorithms

This section includes the implementation of the following sorting algorithms:
- Quick Sort
- Heap Sort
- Shell Sort
- Tree Sort

Language: C/C++

## Level 2: Graph Algorithms

This section includes the implementation of the following graph algorithms:
- Dijkstra's Algorithm
- Kruskal's Algorithm
- Prim's Algorithm

Language: C/C++

## Level 3: Finding the Second-Largest Element in an Array

In this task, the goal is to find the second-largest element in an array of integers. The program implements a single-pass algorithm without sorting the array.

Language: C/C++

## Level 4: Maximum Width of a Binary Search Tree (BST)

The objective of this task is to find the maximum width of a binary search tree (BST). The program utilizes a time complexity of O(n), where n represents the number of nodes in the tree. The tree contains unique integer values stored in each node.

Language: C/C++

## Level 5: Game Character Modeling

This task involves modeling a game where players can control different characters, such as warriors, archers, and mages. The program uses object-oriented programming concepts and includes the following classes:
- Character: Represents a character in the game with attributes such as name, health, and level.
- Warrior, Archer, and Mage: Inherited classes from the Character class, each having their own unique abilities.
- Ability: Represents an ability with attributes such as name, damage, and mana cost.

Language: C++

The program allows players to create and control different characters, select and use abilities during gameplay, and displays the current status of the game.
